# [Team Protocol](https://s.icepanel.io/8ed1WNhopjo4xF/wRIp)
Synthesis (Domain-First)
Team Protocol is a domain-driven contract that defines how a team exists, operates, and makes decisions.
A team is treated as a bounded domain, with explicit identity, responsibilities, and interaction rules.

In this model:

A team is a domain, not just a group of people.
The Team Protocol is the domain contract.
Platforms, tools, and methodologies operate inside the domain, never defining it.
Explicit rules replace implicit culture.
This transforms collaboration into a reliable sociotechnical system.
