## Domain Pair Protocol — Synthesis

> **Domain Pair Protocol defines how two developers or architects pair by resolving identity through domains, before interacting through platforms or tools.**

In this protocol:

* **Pairing starts at the domain level**, analogous to DNS resolution.
* A **domain represents authoritative identity**, not a platform account.
* A **primary nick is bound to the domain** as the human identifier.
* Platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket provide **team execution contexts**, already scoped by their own domains.

### How to pair with another developer or architect?

1. **Primary Nick (Human Identity)**

   * Identify the main nick of the developer or architect you want to pair with.

2. **Primary Team (Platform Domain)**

   * Identify the primary team where this nick operates
     (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket domains).

> **Domains resolve identity.
> Teams execute collaboration.
> Pairing is a domain-level operation.**
