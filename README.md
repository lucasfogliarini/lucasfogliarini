# [Domain-Oriented Collaboration Protocol (MCP-like)](https://s.icepanel.io/8ed1WNhopjo4xF/wRIp)
Synthesis (Domain-First)
Team Protocol is a domain-oriented collaboration protocol, similar in nature to the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
It defines a team as a bounded domain and standardizes how context, responsibilities, and interactions are exposed and consumed.

In this model:
A team is a domain.

The Team Protocol is the domain’s protocol, not its tooling.

Just as MCP standardizes how context is exchanged between models and tools,
Team Protocol standardizes how context is exchanged between people, roles, and systems.

Platforms operate inside the protocol, never defining it.

This turns collaboration into a deterministic sociotechnical interface.
